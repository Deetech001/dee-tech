        <p>Further information: Gender disparities in health and Men's health
            While a majority of the global health gender disparities is weighted against women, there are situations in which men tend to fare poorer. One such instance is armed conflicts, where men are often the immediate victims. A study of conflicts in 13 countries from 1955 to 2002 found that 81% of all violent war deaths were male.[21] Apart from armed conflicts, areas with high incidence of violence, such as regions controlled by drug cartels, also see men experiencing higher mortality rates.[22] This stems from social beliefs that associate ideals of masculinity with aggressive, confrontational behavior.[23] Lastly, sudden and drastic changes in economic environments and the loss of social safety nets, in particular social subsidies and food stamps, have also been linked to higher levels of alcohol consumption and psychological stress among men, leading to a spike in male mortality rates. This is because such situations often makes it harder for men to provide for their family, a task that has been long regarded as the "essence of masculinity."[24] A retrospective analyses of people infected with the common cold found that doctors underrate the symptoms of men, and are more willing to attribute symptoms and illness to women than men.[25] Women live longer than men in all countries, and across all age groups, for which reliable records exist.[26] In the United States, men are less healthy than women across all social classes. Non-white men are especially unhealthy. Men are over-represented in dangerous occupations and represent a majority of on the job deaths. Further, medical doctors provide men with less service, less advice, and spend less time with men than they do with women per medical encounter.[27]</p>

        <p>See also: Work (human activity)
            Men have traditionally held jobs that were not available to women. Such jobs tended to be either more strenuous, more prestigious, or more dangerous. Modern men increasingly take untraditional career paths, such as staying home and raising children while their partner works.[61] Modern men tend to work longer than women, which impacts their ability to spend time with their families.[62] Even in modern times, some jobs remain available only to men, such as military service.[63] Conscription is overwhelmingly discriminatory, currently only ten countries include women in their conscription programs.[64][65] Men continue to hold more dangerous jobs than women, even in developed countries. In the United States in 2020, ten times as many men died on the job as women, and a man was ten times more likely to die on the job than a woman.[66]
            
            Entertainment and media
            Media portrayals of men often replicate traditional understanding of masculinity. Men are portrayed more frequently in television than women and most commonly appear as leads in action and drama programming. Men are typically more active in television programming than women and typically hold more power and status. Due to their prominence, men are more likely to be both the objects and instigators of humorous or disparaging content. Fathers are often portrayed in television as either idealized and caring or clumsy and inept. In advertising, men are disproportionately featured in advertisements for alcohol, vehicles, and business products.[67]</p>

        <p>Further information: Male privilege and Discrimination against men
            In most societies, men have more legal and cultural rights than women,[46] and misogyny is far more prevalent than misandry in society.[74][75] Men typically receive less support after being victims of sexual assault, and rape of males is stigmatized.[76] Domestic violence against men is similarly stigmatized.[77] Opponents of circumcision describe it as a human rights violation.[78] The fathers' rights movement seeks to support separated fathers that do not receive equal rights to care for their children.[79] The men's movement is the response to issues faced by men in Western countries. It includes pro-feminist groups such as the men's liberation movement and anti-feminist groups such as the manosphere.
            
            Gender symbol
            Main article: Gender symbol
            The Mars symbol (♂) is a common symbol that represents the male sex.[80] The symbol is identical to the planetary symbol of Mars.[81] It was first used to denote sex by Carl Linnaeus in 1751.[82] The symbol is sometimes seen as a stylized representation of the shield and spear of the Roman god Mars. According to Stearn, however, this derivation is "fanciful" and all the historical evidence favours "the conclusion of the French classical scholar Claude de Saumaise" that it is derived from θρ, the contraction of a Greek epithet for Mars, θοῦρος (Thouro</p>
